[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rodrimati1992/type_level.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rodrimati1992/type_level)

Examples of using type-level values and functions.

You are free to copy any of the examples here,improvements to this examples should be (preferably) an issue or a pull request.

This is a library purely so that `docs.rs` can show documentation for it,
do not use this crate as a dependency.

To run the examples do `cargo run -- ` and then add one of the arguments from the help message.

**Please create issues for any problem.**

This crate uses [`derive_type_level`](https://crates.io/crates/derive_type_level) to access the 
`TypeLevel` and `MutConstValue` derive macros,
and [`type_level_values`](https://crates.io/crates/type_level_values)
for types and traits related to type-level values and functions.
